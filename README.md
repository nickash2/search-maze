# Lab Assignment 1: Agents & Search

## Prerequisites:
* Python >=3.8

## TODO List:

- [x] Implement Greedy Search
- [x] Implement A*
- [ ] Implement UCS

### Notes
* For UCS, we need to order the priorty queue on the cost, as currently we are ordering it on the room number. 
    * That can be done by creating a class, and pushing the cost to the fringe rather than the number
